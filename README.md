## EV3 Workshop notes
Two ways to connect to EV3, mainly want to use wireless connection.

Connect via: ssh@robot[ip address of EV3 device]

Use ssh to connect to EV3 device and run python files via python3 [name of python file].py

To send python files across, use scp [name of python file].py robot@[ip of EV3 device]:/home:/robot

There is a password to scp into EV3 device which is: 'maker' (potential to change)

Ports 1-4: input
Ports A-D: output
